Climate Change Analysis Project 

##Overview
This project aims to analyze various aspects of climate change using a diverse set of datasets. We explore global trends as well as specific patterns within India, focusing on major metropolitan cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai. Through interactive visualizations created using R-Shiny, we provide insights into temperature variations, sea level changes, CO2 emissions, precipitation patterns, and frequency of climate-related disasters.

##Datasets Used
Global Land Temperatures By City
Change in Mean Sea Levels
Climate Related Disasters Frequency
CO2 Emissions
Delhi Climate Change 2019-2020
Global Land Temperatures By Country
Global Land Temperatures By Major City
Global Land Temperatures By State
Global Temperatures
Precipitation
Visualizations


##We utilized a variety of visualization techniques to present the climatic changes effectively:

Scatterplots
Bar Graphs
Density Maps
World Map Visualization
Line Plots
Box Plots


##Components
Global Trends: Analyzing global temperature trends, sea level changes, and CO2 emissions to illustrate the broader picture of climate change.
Indian Perspective: Focusing on major metropolitan cities in India (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai) to highlight localized climate variations and their impact.
Interactive Dashboard: A user-friendly R-Shiny dashboard providing an interactive platform to explore and understand the datasets through dynamic visualizations.

##How to Use
To explore the visualizations and insights provided by this project:

1.Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.Navigate to the directory containing the R-Shiny code.
3.Run the application using R or RStudio.
4.Interact with the dashboard to view different plots and analyze climate change data.
